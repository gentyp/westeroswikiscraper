Prince Rhaegar Targaryen was the firstborn son of King Aerys II Targaryen and his sister-wife, Queen Rhaella. As heir-apparent, he was the Prince of Dragonstone and crown prince for the Iron Throne. Rhaegar was popular with the smallfolk during his lifetime, but he died in Robert's Rebellion which was triggered in part by his abduction of Lyanna Stark. He was slain in single combat by Robert Baratheon at the ruby ford during the battle of the Trident. Rhaegar was the elder brother of the exiled last members of House Targaryen, Prince Viserys and Princess Daenerys.
In the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Rhaegar is portrayed by Wilf Scolding in flashbacks.

Prince Rhaegar was the firstborn son of King Aerys II Targaryen and Queen Rhaella. He was born at Summerhall in 259 AC, on the same day as the great tragedy there.
At the age of seventeen, Rhaegar was knighted, and from all reports grew into a highly skilled and capable fighter, always distinguishing himself well at tournaments, although he seldom entered the lists - he never loved the song of swords the way that men like Robert Baratheon or Jaime Lannister did.
Rhaegar's squires were Myles Mooton and Richard Lonmouth, and after he knighted them they remained close companions. Jon Connington, whom he had squired with,
Rhaegar often liked to visit the ruins of Summerhall with only his harp and when he returned he sang songs of such beauty they could reduce women to tears. Although Rhaegar was often dour, private and bookish, Cersei Lannister noted at the tournament in honor of Viserys's birth in Lannisport in 276 AC that the smallfolk cheered for Lord Tywin Lannister twice as much as for King Aerys II, but only half as loudly for Tywin as for Rhaegar.
Rhaegar was born at a time when the Targaryen's had declined, and once he came of age, there was no sister, or anyone else of their bloodline, available for him to marry.
After this in early 279 AC, Rhaegar was formally betrothed to the Dornish princess, Elia Martell, the younger sister of Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne. They married the following year in 280 AC, a lavish ceremony was held at the Great Sept of Baelor. His father did not attend the wedding as he was paranoid about an assassination attempt and nor did he permit the young Prince Viserys to attend. Rhaegar and his father's relationship was straining at this point, and he and his new bride took up residence on Dragonstone instead of King's Landing. Rhaegar and Elia had their first child, a girl named Rhaenys,
Elia and Rhaegar had a son they named Aegon. Elia, due to her delicate health, was bed-ridden for half a year after giving birth to Rhaenys and nearly died giving birth to Aegon, after which the maesters told Rhaegar she would be unable to have any more children.
Maester Aemon, whom Rhaegar corresponded with via raven messages, remembers that Rhaegar believed his child Aegon to be the prince that was promised.
When Lord Tywin resigned his position as Hand of the King and left court, the new focus of King Aerys's mistrust and paranoia was his own son and heir, Prince Rhaegar. At court, there was growing tension between factions loyal to the king and to the prince. Grand Maester Pycelle dispatched a letter to the Citadel, writing that tensions and division at court strongly resembled those before the Dance of the Dragons. Pycelle was fearful a civil war would break out unless some accord could be reached that would satisfy both factions.
In either 280 AC or 281 AC,
During the great tourney at Harrenhal, Rhaegar seemed unstoppable and defeated even Ser Arthur Dayne. Taking the winter rose crown for the queen of love and beauty, he revealed his interest in Lyanna Stark by passing over his wife, Princess Elia of Dorne, and setting it in Lyanna's lap. Eddard Stark later recalled that moment as "when all the smiles died". The next year, Rhaegar seemingly kidnapped Lyanna, for reasons unknown. This act ultimately triggered Robert's Rebellion and the downfall of the Targaryen dynasty.
Some believe that Rhaegar spent the beginning of Robert's Rebellion, also known as the War of the Usurper, with Lyanna Stark at the tower of joy in the Red Mountains of Dorne. King Aerys sent Ser Gerold Hightower, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, to retrieve Rhaegar. Leaving Ser Gerold, Ser Arthur Dayne, and Ser Oswell Whent at the tower,
Rhaegar met Lord Robert Baratheon in combat at a ford during the battle of the Trident, where the pair had a legendary duel in the raging rivers of the Trident. Rhaegar, despite wounding Robert, was struck down with a massive blow from Robert's warhammer, which scattered the rubies encrusted in Rhaegar's armor into the water. While Rhaegar lay dead in the stream, soldiers of both armies scrabbled in the water to search for the rubies. The location was named the ruby ford thereafter. Rhaegar died with Lyanna Stark's name on his lips.
His wife Elia and their children were murdered by Ser Gregor Clegane and Ser Amory Lorch during the sack of King's Landing. Amory dragged the screaming girl, Rhaenys, from under her father's bed and stabbed her to death. Gregor, whom Rhaegar had knighted, killed the infant Aegon by dashing his head against the wall while his mother watched. He then raped and killed Elia while still covered in the blood and brains of her son.
The circumstances of Rhaegar's taking of Lyanna, and of her reaction to it, remain unknown. The Starks, Brandon Stark in particular, saw it as an abduction, and Robert Baratheon imagined that Rhaegar was raping Lyanna while he kept her prisoner. However, the Targaryen tradition sees Rhaegar acting out of true love for Lyanna. Lord Eddard Stark, Lyanna's brother, and Lord Howland Reed found her at Rhaegar's tower of joy in Dorne.
What all sides seem to agree upon is that the meeting of Rhaegar and Lyanna was fateful as it led to immense bloodshed. This leads to imaginations of an alternate history, in which Rhaegar never became infatuated with Lyanna. Viserys Targaryen blames his sister Daenerys once for the downfall of the Targaryens, because she was not born earlier, as Rhaegar could then have married her and might have never become interested in Lyanna.
Discussing Robert's Rebellion with Lord Eddard Stark, King Robert I Baratheon vilifies Rhaegar for raping Ned's sister, Lyanna.
When the royal party moving south from Winterfell to King's Landing reaches the ruby ford, Arya Stark and her friend Mycah decide to search the Trident for rubies from Rhaegar's armor.
During her fever dream, Daenerys Targaryen sees her brother Rhaegar mounted on a stallion as black as his armor. Fire glimmers red through the narrow eye slit of his helm. When Daenerys lifts his polished black visor, the face within is her own.
When Lord Tywin Lannister discusses with his brother Ser Kevan and his son Tyrion the dire situation of the Lannister forces after the defeats in the battle in the Whispering Wood and the battle of the Camps, Tyrion jests that his father should take comfort from the fact that Prince Rhaegar is still dead.
The green and bronze Rhaegal, one of three dragons hatched by Daenerys, is named in honor of her brave brother who was killed on the green banks of the Trident.
Rhaegar appears in Daenerys's vision in the House of the Undying. He discusses with his wife, Elia Martell, what he will name his son (Aegon) and his destiny. Rhaegar states that the boy is the prince that was promised and his is the song of ice and fire. Dany also has a vision of Rhaegar's death at the ruby ford of the Trident at the hands of Robert Baratheon.
While aboard the ship Balerion, Arstan Whitebeard tells Daenerys that Rhaegar was able and dutiful. While Rhaegar was bookish in his youth, he decided to become a warrior after reading about something unknown in his scrolls.
While resting his head on a weirwood stump, Ser Jaime Lannister has a fever dream of five of his old Kingsguard brothers under King Aerys II Targaryen. Beside them, crowned in mist and grief with his long hair streaming behind him, rides Rhaegar, who burns with a cold light of changing colors. Rhaegar's shade accuses Jaime of not protecting his family during the sack of King's Landing.
While standing vigil over the funeral bier of his father, Lord Tywin Lannister, Jaime recalls the day he said farewell to Rhaegar, in the yard of the Red Keep. Rhaegar had wanted to call a council after Robert's Rebellion was suppressed, but the prince was instead killed at the Trident.
Queen Regent Cersei Lannister remembers wanting to marry Rhaegar after meeting him at the tournament in honor of Viserys's birth, but Aerys refused Tywin's suggestion of betrothal. Cersei, Robert's widow, never forgave Robert for killing Rhaegar at the ruby ford.
Prior to Daenerys marrying Hizdahr zo Loraq, Ser Barristan Selmy tells her that Rhaegar was very fond of Elia Martell; Dany thinks the word fond speaks volumes.
Barristan later regrets having rescued King Aerys II from Duskendale, as he thinks Rhaeger would have been a better king than Jaehaerys II, Aerys II, or Robert I.
Traveling south on the Rhoyne, Tyrion Lannister discovers the sellsword Griff is actually Jon Connington, the exiled friend of Rhaegar and former Hand of the King to Aerys II. The youth called Young Griff is said to actually be Rhaegar's son, Aegon Targaryen, widely believed to have been murdered by Ser Gregor Clegane during the sack of King's Landing. The exiles claim that Varys had switched the infant Aegon with a peasant baby and taken Aegon to safety with Illyrio Mopatis, and that Gregor killed the peasant child instead.
Jon discusses the issue of trust with Aegon, and then recalls that Rhaegar had been aware of Aerys's paranoia.
